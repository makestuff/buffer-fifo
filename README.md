## Buffer FIFO
You can git submodule this repo to provide a generic single-clock FIFO with configurable thresholds. See [`altera-pcie`](https://github.com/makestuff/altera-pcie) repo for an example of how to do this.

For simulation, you'll need the [`altera-libs`](https://github.com/makestuff/altera-libs) repo built alongside this.
